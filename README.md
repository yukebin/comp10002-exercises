# Suggested Solutions: Programming, Problem Solving, and Abstraction with C

This repository contains my suggested solution for the textbook, "[**Programming, Problem Solving, and Abstraction with C**](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/ammoffat/ppsaa/)", Pearson Custom Books, Sydney, Australia, 2002; revised edition 2012, ISBN 9781486010974. It is written by [Alistair Moffat](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/ammoffat/) for the subject *Foundations of Algorithms - COMP10002* (commonly known as *FoA*) at the University of Melbourne.

## About

_Programming, Problem Solving, and Abstraction with C_ (PPSAA) is a legendary textbook among Computing and Data Science students at the university. _FoA_ is one of the first computing subjects taken by CS and DS students, introducing the semantics of C programming and exploring common algorithms in the latter part of the course.

Many UniMelb students use this textbook as a quick reference or a refresher for C in later subjects like *Design of Algorithms - COMP20007 (DoA)* and *Computer Systems - COMP30023 (CompSys)*. It is a great book and I recommend it to anyone who is even a little curious about programming.

I undertook this subject in my first year (2023). Although I did not focus as much as I should have (due to my poor decision to take advanced math and physics simultaneously), I still thoroughly enjoyed the subject.

Our favorite lecturer, Shaanan, has uploaded a free course at [https://algorithmsare.fun/](https://algorithmsare.fun/). If you would like to follow along with the subject while referencing the textbook, be sure to check out the videos!

## Disclaimer 

Error handling has been mostly omitted for the sake of concise code, but it is left to you to properly implement robust error handling. It follows that this repository should not be taken as a solution manual for the textbook. 

Whilst I have taken the utmost care to ensure the correctness of these solutions (albeit the error handling), there may still be errors. If you spot any issues, please let me know.

All credit goes to Alistair who wrote the textbook and exercises.
