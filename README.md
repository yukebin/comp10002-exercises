# Suggested Solutions: Programming, Problem Solving, and Abstraction with C

This repository contains my suggested solution for the textbook, "[**Programming, Problem Solving, and Abstraction with C**](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/ammoffat/ppsaa/)", Pearson Custom Books, Sydney, Australia, 2002; revised edition 2012, ISBN 9781486010974. It is written by [Alistair Moffat](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/ammoffat/) for the subject *Foundations of Algorithms - COMP10002* (commonly known as *FoA*) at the University of Melbourne.

## About

_Programming, Problem Solving, and Abstraction with C_ (PPSAA) is a legendary textbook among Computing and Data Science students. _FoA_ is one of the first computing subjects undertaken by CS and DS students. It introduces the semantics of C programming and delves into algorithms in the latter part of the subject.

Most of unimelb students uses this textbook as a quick reference or a refresher for C for later subjects like *Design of Algorithms - COMP20007 (DoA)* and *Computer Systems - COMP30023 (CompSys)*. It is a great book and I recommend anyone who are even a little bit curious of programming. 

I undertook this subject in my first year (2023). Although I did not focus as much as I should have (due to my poor decision to take advanced math and physics simultaneously), I still thoroughly enjoyed the subject.
